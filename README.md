# Elite Product Marker

**Elite Product Marker** is a WordPress plugin designed to allow store owners to mark premium products in their WooCommerce store. These products will be highlighted with special status and visibility, similar to the product highlighting style seen in marketplaces like **Daraz**. By marking products as "Elite," you can give them more prominence on the site.

## Features

- Mark products as **Elite** directly from the WooCommerce product editing page.
- Automatically assign the **Elite** category to marked products.
- Display an image alongside the product title on the frontend to visually highlight elite products.
- Customizable image and target URL for elite products via the plugin settings page.
- Provides a simple, efficient way to mark and promote special products in your store.

## Installation

1. **Download the plugin**: Download the plugin files from the repository.
2. **Upload to WordPress**: Upload the `elite-product-marker` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress site.
3. **Activate the plugin**: Go to the **Plugins** menu in WordPress, find the **Elite Product Marker**, and click **Activate**.
4. **Use the Plugin**: 
    - Navigate to the **Product Data** panel in any product page in WooCommerce.
    - Check the **Mark as Elite Product** checkbox to mark the product as elite.
    - This product will automatically be assigned to the **Elite** category and display an image link around the title.

## Admin Settings

- After installation, navigate to **WooCommerce > Elite Product Settings** in the WordPress admin.
- You will see fields to set the **Elite Product Image URL** and **Elite Product Target URL**. These settings control the image and link displayed around the product title for elite products.
- Enter the image URL (for example, `https://example.com/elite-badge.png`) and the target URL (e.g., `https://example.com/elite-products/`).
  
**Example**:
  - Image URL: `https://example.com/elite-badge.png`
  - Target URL: `https://example.com/elite-products/`

## Usage

1. **Mark Products as Elite**: 
   - When editing a product in WooCommerce, you'll see the checkbox **"Mark as Elite Product"** under the **Product Data** section.
   - Checking this box will mark the product as elite, assign it to the **Elite** category, and display an image next to the product title on the frontend.
  
2. **Customize the Elite Image**: 
   - You can update the image URL and the target link using the admin settings page. This will allow you to change the image used for elite products and the URL users will be directed to when they click on the image.
