# Elite Product Marker

**Elite Product Marker** is a simple WordPress plugin designed to allow store owners to mark premium products in their WooCommerce store. These products will be highlighted with special status and visibility, similar to the Daraz Mall product style. This plugin helps to promote special products by marking them as "Elite."

## Features

- Mark products as **Elite** within the product editing page in WooCommerce.
- Automatically assign the "Elite" category to marked products.
- Add a visual indicator (image link) around the product title on the frontend.
- The plugin mimics the product highlighting style seen in marketplaces like **Daraz**.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files.
2. Upload the `elite-product-marker` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your WordPress site.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Navigate to the product page in WooCommerce and check the "Mark as Elite Product" checkbox for the products you want to highlight.

## Usage

Once activated, you'll see a checkbox called **"Mark as Elite Product"** in the **Product Data** panel when editing a product. Check this box to mark a product as an elite product, and it will automatically be assigned to the **Elite** category and display an image around the title on the frontend.

## Customization

- The plugin adds an image link around the product title on the frontend for **elite products**. You can customize the image URL and link destination by editing the plugin code.
